## **2 JULY 2025 (Idea and Development)**

### **(1PM-5PM)**
After Creating TOYZY The 3D printer I thought that what will be my first build ,the Thought was just entered in my mind And after a deepthought a thought i should watch and complete squid game web series on NETFLIX ,and During it a sudden thought came to my mind that i should build a Ganola candy 3D model ,after many Rejection to the idea ,finally stood for one that ishoud build and umbrela logo and integrate it with NFC and a some leds for light 

So after some RnD about the design and creating several models finally landed on This

Though it was not looking like candy so Decided to Give a Colour and And Transparent View for led clock

Though i was aleady have some knowledge about arduino boards which i got in the last week creating a 3d printer so moved to circuit part  and decide to use ardiuno nano with  WS2812B led strip light and NT3H2111W0FT1X nfc chip and a custom made coil for nfc 

# 1st Challenge 
during the Whole Project I forgot to Save My files and Chekup the Disk Storage ,so when I took a break for 30 minutes and came back got know nothing was left as the fusion keep on consuming battery as it was on performanc + quality mode it made battery drain , after a restart dont know why i get a message that restored files of fusion got corrupted ,so I have To make It From Zero So Diceded To It Tommorow

Total Time of THe Day:- 5 Hours

## **3 JULY 2025 (Completion)**

### **(3PM-6PM)**
after yesterdays lost i was bit Depressed, but i am hard core speed runner today my goal was to Complete it in just 2 Hours

now it was time to finilze the pcb and add it to the model so Just check if everything was right but got little bit confused ,but being confident i move on with scheme that made yeseterday i quickly arranged the components to board and add some silkscreen to it to make it look good then Exported it as 3d modeland and added to the fusion make things arranged and put a lyer of glass and added umbrella on top

please let me know if there is somthing wrong in circuit , as i have not have that much experience with NFC CHips
yeah i now the model is now more bigger in height and is changed, but trust me it is less than 1.8 cm in real as i have planed to make it edge to edge with the engraving tool and manually fix it and will add the usb port after manual and some  physical changes to the model as these things can be fixed by understandings things when there are in hand .
I have Also Decided to Giveaway a deck and some real dalgona candies read the read.me to get more details...
Total Time of THe Day:- 3 Hours
